	<h3> Project 3- Bouncing Ball, 3/24/2022 </h3> <br />

	<p> For this project, I animated a pretty bouncy ball on its adventure to escape the solar system. </p><br />

	<br />
	
	<p> There are more than three animation principles present here, so I'll show examples of the main three.</p><br />
	<br />

	<p> 1- Squash and Stretch. This took a bit of a backseat to the other techniques, but is used to convey
	that the ball is a bit rubbery as well as that it moves very fast in the solar system. The technique can be 
	seen in full effect in the scenes on Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn. </p><br />

	<img src="https://github.com/pandaimporter/cs417/blob/main/p3_squash2.PNG?raw=true" alt="source" style="width:800px;height:500px;">  
	<br />
	<br />

	<p> 2- Anticipation. Highly utilized here. Every time something the ball encounters a new object, said object
	is shown approaching the ball before it interacts with the ball (sometimes the ball acts in response!) </p><br />

	<br />
	<br />

	<p> 3- Appeal. Although the subject of the animation is simply a ball, I tried to inject some charisma into the
	ball in order to make people root for it(and be disappointed in the final scene). The ball has a
	beautifully crafted MS Paint smiley face, and interacts with the viewers through holding up quirky signs in order
	to establish a connection between the audience and the ball. </p><br />

	<br />

	<p> Examples of overlapping action, exaggeration, and timing can be found as well. </p><br />
	<br />

	<p> Why baby yoda appears in the UFO is up to your interpretation. My personal interpretation is that he was
	trying to get a new pinball high score, but that he went away in shame after the ball burned up. </p>
