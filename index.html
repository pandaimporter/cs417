	<h3>Project 1- Solar System, 2/17/2022 </h3> <br />

	<p> The tutorial part of Project 1 is below. I modified the orbits for this one, and the background is gray due to when I did this project. </p>

	<p> For the creative part of this project, I first added a background and decided to pan the camera to give the animation a cool "moving effect."
	I also added many objects to the solar system, which include: <br />
	
	<br />

	- a full asteroid belt, which was made by iteratively copy-pasting objects in a group to preserve animation qualities. <br />

	<br />

	- verticality and an axis tilt for Saturn, axis tilt for Jupiter <br />
	- a ufo and a small comet <br />
