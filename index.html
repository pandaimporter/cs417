	<h3> Final Project, 5/13/22  </h3> <br />

	<p> This was fun to animate and annoying to render. Water and fire was done using Bifrost liquid and Bifrost
        presets for fire, and the grass was made using Xgen interactive groom. All other figures were made using Maya and
        Arnold models and shaders or with models given below in the sources. Lighting was done with Arnold's area lights
	and physical sky lights. After-effects and post-production was done in Adobe Premiere Pro. Movement is a mix of
        keyframing and dynamics to achieve realism and appealing animation in different sections. </p><br />

	<p> PSA for any future CS417 students: use the media center computers if you'd like to use Arnold. </p><br />
