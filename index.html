	<h3>Project 1</h3> <br />

	<p> The tutorial part of Project 1 is below.
	I don't like a straight line of planets, so I modified the orbits to not look so static. </p>

	<p> For the creative part of this project, I first added a background and decided to pan the camera to give the animation a cool "moving effect."
	I also added many objects to the solar system, which include: <br />
	- a full asteroid belt <br />
	- vertical ring for uranus <br />
	- a ufo and a small comet moving kind of erratically <br />
	- axis tilts/verticality for jupiter and saturn </p>
