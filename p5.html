	<p> For this project, I scripted a domino collision chain using MASH and Python. The full script is posted
	at the bottom of the webpage. The hardest part of this project was the API diving and the amount of time it
	took to find the proper command for a tiny part of the animation. </p><br />

	<p> Here is the before-and-after image used for the domino grid. If my math is right, there should be 8100 dominos on the board. </p><br />

	<p> Here is the video of the dominos being knocked over. There were three minor sins committed to get the video out-
	I could not figure out how to edit system preferences using python, so I manually had to turn on lighting, textures, and a black background. </p><br />
